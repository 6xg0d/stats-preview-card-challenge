## My process

It was a little bit difficult to implement the responsive since i'm still not used to the media queries, but i got it done. Still seeing some issues in the layout, but after getting some more practice and knowledge i'd like to fix them.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Practicing some more semantic, responsive and working with different sizes.

### Continued development

Would like to improve the layout, the CSS file, and be able to set the overlay on top of the image.
